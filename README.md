REASON FOR CHOOSING A-FRAME OVER THE OTHER VR
A-Frame is a web framework used to build virtual reality experiences.
 It was created by Mozilla VR to make WebVR content creation easier, faster, and more accessible.
A-Frame lets you build scenes with HTML while giving you unlimited access to JavaScript, three.js, and all existing Web APIs.
 A-Frame uses an entity-component-system pattern that promotes composition and extensibility.
  It is free and open-source with a welcoming community and a thriving ecosystem of tools and components.
A-frame is more easy to use than the other virtual reality technologies.
